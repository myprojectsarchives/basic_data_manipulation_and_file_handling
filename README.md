# Basic Data Manipulation and File Handling

## Description
This project demonstrates basic file handling and data manipulation using Python. It reads numerical data from a text file, processes each value by squaring it, and writes the results to an output file.

## Features
- Reads numbers from a text file
- Processes data using Python
- Writes processed output to a new file
- Simple and beginner-friendly implementation

## Input
A text file containing numbers, with one number per line.

## Output
A text file containing the square of each input number.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- File Handling
- List Comprehension

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system
2. Place the input file in the same directory as the script
3. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python main.py
